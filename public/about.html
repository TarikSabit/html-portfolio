<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tarik-Sabit MujagiÄ‡. I live and work in Tuzla. Bosnia and herzegovina. This is my home town and the place where I grew up.</p>

<p>I developed an interest in web development quite recently and started learning on Udemy.com. I currently only know html but I will surely learn more in the future.</p>

<p>I make web pages in html 5 but will soon learn CSS and make my web pages way cooler.</p>
